## Inspiration
Amazon is an American Tech Multi-National Company whose business interests include E-commerce, where they buy and store the inventory, and take care of everything from shipping and pricing to customer service and returns. This dataset is created so that people can perform various analyses and tasks such as:
- Dataset Walkthrough
- Understanding Dataset Hierarchy
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Visualization
- Making Recommendation System

This list is not exhaustive, and many more analyses can be performed with this dataset.

*Note:* The symbol used to represent rupee wasnâ€™t available and understandable for Excel, so text split was used to extract the numbers, and then the rupee symbol was added. Also, '1' in rating was represented with a symbol that is not standard.

## Additional Analyses Ideas
1. Correlation analysis between numerical features
2. Relationship between ratings and other numerical features (e.g., price).
3. Compare the average ratings across different product categories.
4. Explore the relationship between rating count and actual rating.
